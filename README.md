# Nerf Power Meter
Measures the power of a NERF dart impact.
## Why?
- Compare different NERF toys
- Compare modded vs. vanilla
- Test your aim
- Compare different darts

## How?
1. Build a 'swing'
2. Mount GPN17 badge on swing
3. Fire Dart on swing
4. Let physics take over
-- The impuse is converted into a momentum
-- The maximum elevation is measured with the IMU
-- More elevation means more energy in the system 
5. Read the max elevation from the display
